                <p>This project started as a hobby project, as I didn't like the mobile experience that my college provided. I started by making a rough prototype of the app on Adobe XD, and soon started writing a working prototype Xcode. To make the app usable, I manually copied data from various websites into Excel files to be used in the app. After the app was mostly usable, I sent an email to the User Experience Office at IU and pitched the app to them. Now, I am working at the UX Office alongside with UX Designers and Data Scientists to publish the app for students, faculty, and staff at IU. </p>

            <p>This is the initial prototype I made on Adobe XD. This design is slightly different from the current design, but the idea is the same. My original idea was to have the home screen be a feed that shows relevant information to the user, but because of technical issues, I have decided to change the feed layout to different sections that also shows relevant information. </p>
