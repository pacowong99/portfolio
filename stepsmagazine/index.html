                <p>STEPS is a yearbook designed by 11th grade students to showcase the various classes, activities, and awards of my high school, Diocesan Boys' School. I was initially appointed as the Art Director of the magazine, mainly overlooking the graphics of the magazine. A few months into my role in the Editorial Board, although I have never typeset a publication before, I proactively stepped up and volunteered to become the Chief Typesetter, to be in charge of the layouts of the 300-page yearbook.</p><br>
                <p>We decided that "Ink" would be the theme of the yearbook, with most graphics, including the cover, be pictures of ink injected in water. My partner and I bought the required materials and shot the pictures ourselves in two days. The entire book took around seven months to be published. </p>
